### About

This program has been written using the object-oriented programming language Ruby.

This software is written to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off from the airport and be held in the airport's hangar. The software has been tested so that it will raise errors if:

* The weather conditions are unsuitable for flying.
* The hangar has reached it's full capacity of planes.
* The plane is already in flight.
  ​

The program has met the conditions of the user stories, such as:

* The default capacity of the hangar can be overridden.

* It will state which aeroplane has taken off.

* It will state which plane is currently in the airport.

  ​
